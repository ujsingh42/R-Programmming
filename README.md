Project Tittle: Transcriptome analysis of ovarian cancer OVSAHO cells treated with JIB-04 and cells transfected with siRNA targeting MECOM

Description: The goal of this experiment is to identify differentially expressed genes between OVSAHO cells and JIB-04 treated (6 microM for 72 hours) OVSAHO cells. 
Also, the study identified differentially expressed genes between OVSAHO cells transfected with siRNA targeting Luciferase (control) and OVSAHO cells transfected with 
siRNA specific to MECOM. The siRNA mediated transfection was performed for 72 hours. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). RNA sequencing 
library was performed using SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq kit (Takara).

Data were stored in NCBI with PRJNA1184709
